# Adaptive_Motion_Deblurring

See Example Code Notebook for an example of how to use the changepoint detection and global motion deblurring on the fan data set.

See 2cars (this notebook is still quite messy) for the implementation of the multiple object deblurring. The deblurring algorithm used assumes rigid objects that do not occlude each other. 

Uses python 3.7.0
